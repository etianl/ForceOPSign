  <h1><strong>ForceOpSign</strong></h1>
  <p><strong>This mod allows you to create highly illegal and malicious signs in Minecraft!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Demonstration video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YICXSxkvBfQ</strong></p>
  <p>This requires<strong> Creative Mode</strong> for you to make the illegal sign! The signs placed appear blank and commands executed may not appear in the server chat response for commands. There is also a preset option for griefing the server and crashing all players. </p>
  <p><strong>After making the sign give it to an operator and have them place and click it while they are also in creative mode.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>AN OPERATOR HAS TO PLACE THE SIGN!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>THE OPERATOR HAS TO BE IN CREATIVE MODE!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>SERVERS ON MINECRAFT VERSION 1.20.4 OR LESS REQUIRE THE SIGN TO BE MADE FROM A 1.20.4 CLIENT TO FORMAT THE DATA CORRECTLY!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>There is a button in the 1.20.4 build that must be enabled to format the data correctly for worlds of version 1.19.4 or less!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Only Operators</strong> clicking the sign can execute permission level 3 commands such as <strong>/op</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Any player</strong> clicking the sign can execute permission level 2 commands such as <strong>/fill, /gamerule, /setblock, and more</strong></p>
  <p><strong>In Minecraft versions 1.8-1.8.4 ANYONE with creative mode can place and execute the signs!</strong></p>

Credits to **CrushedPixel** for their first implementation of a ForceOP sign module https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KofDNaPZWfg, and to **etianl** for writing this implementation.

## Features:
- The **"ForceOP"** mode gives you operator status.
- The **"CloneSign"** mode clones the sign to a Y level above it. This is useful for if you can't get op status and you want to keep clicking the sign in the case the first one breaks.
- The **"Crash People"** option crashes out all player's clients on the server other than your own.
- The **"Grief Server"** replaces areas around every player and entity in the world with lava.
- Specify **your own commands** with the Cmd # text fields!
- If any of the first three presets are selected then one or some of the text fields for player defined commands will not be used!
